# VPN Switcher

This is a desktop application for anyone who switches between two or more VPNs on a regular basis.

It provides a better user interface for its use case than Windows, since you can switch between VPNs with a single click, and you'll be automatically disconnected from the previous VPN connection.

## Features

- Switch between two VPNs with a single click.
- JSON-based configuration.
- Lightweight design.

## Installation

1. Ensure NodeJS and NPM are installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Use `npm install` to install all of the dependencies.

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` in the root directory of the application. The file will be autogenerated when you open the application without creating it.

This is a sample of the file:

```json
{
	"vpns": [
		"vpn1",
		"vpn2"
	],
	"scripts": [
		{
			"name": "script-name",
			"path": "C:\\path\\to\\script.js",
			"enabledWhenActiveVPN": "vpn2"
		}
	],
	"bounds": {
		"x": 1689,
		"y": 996
	}
}
```

### vpns
An array of strings which represents the VPN names configured in Windows' VPN settings. 

### scripts
An array of additional scripts that you can execute directly within the application. 
 * `name` Represents the display name of the script on the application's UI.
 * `path` The path to the script.
 * `enabledWhenActiveVPN` Ensures that the script can only be executed when the specified VPN is connected. Default value is null.

### bounds
This is where the application stores its position on the user's screen. These values are changed automatically as you're moving the application window around. When the application is relaunched, it'll be positioned at these coordinates.
